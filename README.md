### Heads up! This repo is archived. I don't use this for work anymore, and don't have the bandwidth to maintain. It needs to be rewritten with Typescript and newer build tools anyway. 

# :globe_with_meridians: Web AppBuilder + React Template

A template for building custom WAB widgets with React and modern JS.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/brygrill/wab-react-webpack.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/brygrill/wab-react-webpack)


## How It Works

Webpack bundles all source code into a single React component. That component is
rendered in `Widget.js` with React DOM. See [the docs](docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md) for
more details.
